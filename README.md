App for Canadian backpackers exploring the world, focusing on safety.

This app will show the government warning index and description, based on a search of country. It will also give basic info about the country needed by the casual traveller. It will also provide a place for travellers to voice their own experiences in the country to encourage or discourage fellow travellers to visit.
